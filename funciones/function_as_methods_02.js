 * Unlike variables, the this keyword does not have a scope, 
 * and nested functions do not inherit the this value of their caller. 
 * If a nested function is invoked as a method, its this value
 * is the object it was invoked on. 
 * If a nested function is invoked as a function then 
 * its this value will be either the global object (non-strict mode)
 * or undefined (strict mode). 
 * If you want to access the this value of the outer function, 
 * you need to store that value into a variable that is in scope
 * for the inner function. It is common to use the variable self for this purpose.
